Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
For example, the square matrix  is shown below:
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
The left-to-right diagonal = 1+ 5 + 9 = 15. The right to left diagonal = 3 + 5 + 9 = 17 Their absolute difference is |15-17| = 2

Function description
diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:
â€¢	arr: an array of integers 

The first line contains a single integer, "n", the number of rows and columns in the matrix "arr".
Each of the next  lines describes a row, "arr[i]", and consists of "n" space-separated integers "arr[i][j]".

Sample Input
3
11    2    4
4     5     6
10    8   -12
Sample Output
